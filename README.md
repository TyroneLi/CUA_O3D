# CUA-O3D: Cross-Modal and Uncertainty-Aware Agglomeration for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding

Welcome to the official repository for **CUA-O3D (Cross-Modal and Uncertainty-Aware Agglomeration for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding)**! This repository hosts the source code, documentation, and resources for the [CUA-O3D project](https://tyroneli.github.io/CUA_O3D/).

## About CUA-O3D
**CUA-O3D** is a cutting-edge framework designed to integrate **3D perception** with **natural language understanding**, enabling advanced scene comprehension and interaction capabilities. By leveraging innovative algorithms and models, CUA-O3D bridges the gap between 3D spatial data and language processing to provide state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as:
- 3D question answering
- Dense captioning
- Semantic understanding

Visit the [CUA-O3D website](https://tyroneli.github.io/CUA_O3D) to explore more details about the project, methodology, and results.
